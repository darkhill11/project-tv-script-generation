# project-tv-script-generation
Contains files for project 4 of the Deep Learning Nano Degree, which consists of using RNN to produce a TV script

In this repository I have the jupyter notebook and other files that I used for the project from Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree on 
the topic of recurrent neural networks.

The objective of the project was to generate a recurrent neural network that was capable of generating a TV script. To train
the network it was utilized scripts from the sitcon "Seinfeld".

Ultimately the network was able to create an specified set of words after the user started gave an input to the network, which
is the name of one of the protagonists of the series.
